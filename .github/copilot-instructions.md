# AI Agent Instructions

This document provides guidance for AI coding assistants working in this codebase.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a new web project that currently contains:
- An empty `index.html` file in the root directory

## Project Structure

```
/
├── index.html         # Main HTML entry point
└── .github/           # GitHub related configuration
```

## Development Workflow

The project structure and workflows are still being established. As the project grows, this section will be updated with:

- Build and development commands
- Testing procedures 
- Deployment processes
- Code organization patterns
- Project-specific conventions

## Key Files

Currently, the main entry point is:
- `index.html` - The root HTML file (empty)

## Next Steps

Consider documenting:

1. The intended architecture and structure as it develops
2. Build tool configuration and commands when added
3. Testing strategy and frameworks chosen
4. Code organization and naming conventions
5. External dependencies and integration points
6. Development workflow and environment setup

This document will evolve alongside the project to help AI agents understand the codebase organization, patterns, and workflows.
