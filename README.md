# 🎭 The "I Need a Website" Adventure

Because every developer needs that one place on the internet to prove they exist! Here's my totally-not-overengineered solution.

## 🎪 What's the Deal?

- **Fancy Glass Effects** ✨
  - Because regular cards are so 2020
  - Yes, I spent way too much time tweaking the blur values
  - No, I regret nothing

- **Bouncy Bubbles** 🫧
  - They serve absolutely no purpose
  - But they spark joy
  - And that's what matters

- **SEO Stuff** 🔍
  - More meta tags than actual content
  - Google will be so impressed
  - Or at least that's what ChatGPT told me

- **Mobile Ready** 📱
  - It better be, I'm an Android dev after all
  - Would be embarrassing otherwise
  - Tests conducted on exactly 1.5 devices

## 🛠️ The "Tech Stack" (trying to keep a straight face)

- HTML5 (yes, I still remember how to write it)
- CSS3 (flexbox is my cardio)
- JavaScript (literally 10 lines of pure dopamine)
- Font Awesome (because life's too short to draw icons)
- Google Fonts (Inter, because who doesn't use Inter in 2025?)

## 🎯 The Part Where I Pretend This Was Complex

Listen, we both know this is just a fancy business card. But here's what makes it special:
- It's mine
- It works
- It has bouncy things
- The glass effect makes it look way fancier than it is
- My mom likes it

## 🚀 Want to Make Your Own?

1. Steal this code (it's fine, I won't tell):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/108hertz/profile-card-web.git
   # Warning: may contain traces of perfectionism
   ```

2. Make it run in your way 🙌

3. Make it yours (but maybe aim higher than a card with bouncy bubbles)

## � A Note About AI

This project was created with the help of AI, because sometimes you need someone to tell you that your blur values could be better.

## � Legal Stuff

MIT License (because sharing is caring, even if it's just a fancy card website)
